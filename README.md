# About
This is my [swap space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/). Have to have it unless [Neuralink](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) is available at mass market for these two reasons:
* to make this stuff durable longer than 30 minutes (which my brain's RAM can offer me at best);
* to be able to share with anyone (well, with future me mostly, but still).

~~Paper~~ Intel inside will endure all.
